## Genome Characterization

- This is the process of analyzing the complete set of genetic instructions (the genome) of an organism.
- It involves identifying the specific DNA or RNA sequences within the genome, understanding how these sequences are organized, and determining their **functions**.
- Genome characterization involves **annotation** and **functional analysis**
  
 <ins>Annotation</ins>
- This is the process of identifying and labeling the functional elements of a genome. It typically includes sequencing the genomes, predicting genes and non-coding elements, and studying regulatory elements, non-coding RNAs and repetitive elements. [Click here for more details](https://www.cd-genomics.com/resource-genome-assembly-annotation-background-workflow-applications.html#:~:text=Genome%20annotation%20is%20the%20process%20of%20identifying,regulatory%20elements%2C%20non%2Dcoding%20RNAs%20and%20repetitive%20elements.)

<ins>Functional analysis</ins>

- This defines the function of a gene using an enormous amount of information including sequence data, mapping and characterization of gene function.
- Functional analysis is crucial in bacterial genomics because it helps in the characterization of resistance and virulence factors/genes. [Read more here](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/8/1/39)
- Antibiotic resistance poses a significant health challenge because drugs that were once highly effective are no longer able to cure bacterial infections
- The primary factor contributing to acquired antimicrobial resistance is often horizontal gene transfer between bacterial isolates. This transfer can occur through various mechanisms such as membrane vesicle fusion, transduction, transformation, and conjugation. In the first part of this practical, we will analyze Whole Genome Sequences to identify antimicrobial resistance genes acquired through horizontal gene transfer.
